<h1>A Message from the General Chairs</h1>

<p>After concerns with the Zika virus
epidemic, we ran a <a href="poll.php">poll</a> including two
questions: (i) whether plans to attend SIGCOMM in Salvador would be
affected, and (ii) if people would attend SIGCOMM if we moved it to a
city still in Brazil, but free of mosquitos and therefore with no risk
of Zika. We got very large majority yes+maybe to the questions.</p>

<p>We discussed with the SIGCOMM executive committee about alternative
cities in the south of Brazil, where the weather is milder and Zika and
mosquitos should not be an issue in August. We decided to move SIGCOMM
to Florianopolis, an island, capital city of Santa Catarina state.
Reports of the tiny number of  cases in the area are only for people
that have visited other parts of Brazil. The risk there is lower than
that now in some southern states of the USA.</p>

<p>In making this decision, we balanced two factors: firstly, that we have a
commitment to hold the conference in Brazil, to serve the south American
community; secondly, that while there&#39;s still a perceived risk, the
reality is that the new venue is as safe as many other places we could move
to. We would remind people of IMC in New Orleans, moved due to Hurricane
Katrina, and the lost day for SIGCOMM in HK due to a Typhoon.</p>

<p>We are <a href="advisory.php">continuing to monitor the situation</a>, but the arrangements for the
relocation have been made, at no additional cost. Transport options for
the new location are pretty much the same as the previous choice, in
terms of hops, for most of the world&#39;s community. Indeed, we will also
be able to offer very low fees (to students in particular) thanks to
cost of services in Brazil.</p>

<p>Every conference location selection has to balance a number of factors,
and we believe this is the right compromise for 2016, and hope to see
many of you in Florianopolis in August 2016, in support of our decision!</p>
