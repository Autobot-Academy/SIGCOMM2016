<h1>N2Women Travel Grant</h1>

<p>
New this year, we are starting an N2Women Travel Grant for young researchers 
to participate in the N2Women event and attend SIGCOMM.
</p>

<p>
SIGCOMM'16 is experimenting a new format for the N2Women event at SIGCOMM. 
The event will be held over a dinner for a longer duration compared to typical 
lunches, and will be conducted a day before the conference. As part of the event, 
we are providing travel awards for up to five under-represented graduate students 
who can attend both the N2women event and SIGCOMM, sponposed by the National 
Science Foundation (this travel grant is contingent about receiving the NSF 
funds in time).
