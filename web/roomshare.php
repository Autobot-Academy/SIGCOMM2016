<p><b>Subject:</b> [sigcomm-roomshare] Need a ride and room</p>

<p>I'm a male PhD student at the University of S&atilde;o Paulo (Brazil), looking for a non-smoking male to share a hotel room. I plan to attend the conference from Tuesday (23rd) to Friday (26th).</p>

<p>Also, is there anyone driving from S&atilde;o Paulo to Florian&oacute;polis for the conference? I am willing to split costs (and drive, if necessary).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
