<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This tutorial consists of two main parts. In the first part, we provide a detailed overview of
IPTV and its building blocks, explain the architectures and protocols used to carry video 
over IP in core, aggregation, access and home networks. We discuss the experiences from 
the existing deployments, and present the relevant standards and current challenges.</p>

<p>In the second part, we survey well-established streaming solutions for over-the-top (OTT) 
video delivery, explaining how OTT video delivery contrasts to traditional broadcast and 
managed IPTV services. We then describe existing and emerging service models reliant 
upon Internet video, including HTTP adaptive streaming along with all the workflows for 
content generation, distribution and consumption. Throughout this part, we review recent 
research findings and discuss future directions. Emerging standards and industry practices 
will be covered as well.</p>

<p>Upon attending this tutorial, the participants will have an understanding of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fundamental differences between IPTV and IP video</li>
  <li>Video transport, protocols and standards for IPTV</li>
  <li>Features of various types of streaming protocols</li>
  <li>Principles of HTTP adaptive streaming</li>
  <li>Content generation, distribution and consumption workflows</li>
  <li>Standards and emerging technologies in IP video space</li>
  <li>Current and future research on managed and unmanaged video delivery</li>
</ul>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Video over IP is a reality to all of us and its growth pace is unprecedented. This is an area 
that cannot be ignored by anybody who is working in the networking field. Unlike most of 
its counterparts that offer mostly theoretic content, this tutorial will focus on practical 
matters such as existing products and solutions that are being used by millions of users 
around the globe and the new developing technologies that will be used by the same users 
in a few years.</p>

    <li>Video distribution in the access networks</li>
    <li>Improving viewer quality of experience</li>
    <li>Today&#39;s challenges</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Part II: Unmanaged Video</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Survey of well-established streaming solutions for OTT video delivery</li>
    <li>Architectural differences between OTT video, traditional broadcast and IPTV</li> 
    <li>Multi-bitrate encoding and encapsulation workflows</li>
    <li>Example deployments including TV Everywhere</li>
    <li>Scaling and improving streaming, multi-screen/hybrid delivery</li>
    <li>Recent research findings and future directions</li>
    <li>Standards and industry practices</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Tutorial Type</h2>

<p>The tutorial will be in the form of a lecture. However, live demonstrations are planned to
show specific examples.</p>

<h2>Expected Audience and Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This tutorial includes both introductory and advanced level information. The audience is 
expected of understanding of basic video coding and IP networking principles. Researchers, 
developers, content and service providers are all welcome.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>

<p><b>Ali C. Begen</b> has joined MediaMelon, Inc. as the principal architect for streaming 
technologies in February 2016, where he is currently heading the development efforts for 
MediaMelon&#39;s content-aware streaming solutions that enable premium viewer experience 
while minimizing operational costs and improving profitability. He has been a research and 
development engineer since 2001, and has broad experience in mathematical modeling, 
performance analysis, optimization, standards development and intellectual property 
innovation. Between 2007 and 2015, he was with the Video and Content Platforms 
Research and Advanced Development Group at Cisco, where he has architected, designed 
and developed algorithms, protocols, products and solutions in the service provider and 
enterprise video domains. Since 2007, he has been leading professional and academic 
projects, and teaching graduate-level courses and giving lectures in universities around the 
world.</p>

<p>Ali holds a Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Tech. He 
received a number of scholar and industry awards, and he has editorial positions in 
prestigious magazines and journals in the field. He is a senior member of the IEEE and a 
senior member of the ACM. More recently, in January 2016, he was elected as a 
distinguished lecturer by the IEEE Communications Society. Further information on his 
projects, publications, keynotes, tutorials, and teaching, standards and professional
