<h1>ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Networking and Programming Languages (NetPL 2016)</h1>

<p>Co-located with ACM SIGCOMM'16, August 22-26, 2016, Salvador, Brazil.</p>

<!-- <h2>Technical Program</h2> -->

<!-- <?php include("include/program/todo.php"); ?> -->

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The NetPL workshop will provide a forum to bring together researchers
and practitioners from the fields of programming languages, formal
methods, and networking. Recent technological trends, such as
software-defined networking and network functions virtualization, have
created an opportunity for researchers in these traditionally separate
communities to collaborate, applying their diverse perspectives
towards the development of novel networking applications. But the
interaction between the two areas goes back a long way, since
domain-specific languages such as pcap and BPF, have been used in
networking for decades. The workshop will target the broadest
interpretation of the intersection between networking and programming
languages, and will not be specially focused on SDN. The program will
consist of invited talks, with an emphasis on encouraging engaging
technical discussions amongst the attendees.
