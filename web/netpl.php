<h2>Call for Participation and Presentations</h2>

<p>The NetPL workshop provides a forum to bring together researchers and
practitioners from the fields of programming languages, formal
methods, and networking.</p>

<p>Recent technological trends, such as Software-Defined Networking,
Network Functions Virtualization and reconfigurable networking
hardware, have created an opportunity for researchers in these
traditionally separate communities to collaborate, applying their
diverse perspectives towards the development of novel networking
applications. It is important to clarify that the scope of this
workshop goes strictly beyond SDN. We aim to enable language
specialists to better understand opportunities in networking, and
networking specialists to better understand opportunities enabled by
specially-designed languages.</p>

<!-- p>This is the second NetPL workshop, after
<a href="http://2015.ecoop.org/track/netpl-2015-workshop">last year's
workshop</a> at ECOOP. All talks in the previous edition of the workshop are on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqU8E2n4MHthZUVb1xK2nRQ">YouTube</a>.</p -->

<p>The program will include invited talks from experts in the field,
with an emphasis on encouraging engaging technical discussions
amongst the participants.</p>

<p>We are also soliciting contributions from prospective participants in
the form of talk proposals to broaden the research that is discussed
at the workshop. Each accepted talk will get a slot of up to 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>Topics of Interest</h3>

<p>We give no firm guidelines on topics (go wild but stay within scope!),
however we particularly seek talks that can provoke thought and
discussion.</p>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>Submit an abstract of at most 1 page length, which will be
lightly reviewed. No feedback will be given. Abstracts will not be
published. The submission site is <a href="https://netpl16.hotcrp.com/">https://netpl16.hotcrp.com/</a>.</p>
