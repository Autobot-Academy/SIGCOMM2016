<h1>ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Networking and Programming Languages (NetPL 2016)</h1>

<p>Co-located with ACM SIGCOMM'16, August 22-26, 2016, Salvador, Brazil.</p>

<!-- <h2>Technical Program</h2> -->

<!-- <?php include("include/program/todo.php"); ?> -->

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The NetPL workshop provides a forum to bring together researchers and
practitioners from the fields of programming languages, formal methods, and
networking.</p>

<p>Recent technological trends, such as software-defined networking, network
functions virtualization and reconfigurable networking hardware, have created
an opportunity for researchers in these traditionally separate communities to
collaborate, applying their diverse perspectives towards the development of
novel networking applications. It is important to clarify that the scope of
this workshop goes strictly beyond SDN.  We aim to enable language specialists
to better understand opportunities in networking, and networking specialists
to better understand opportunities enabled by specially-designed languages.
</p>

<p>The program will consist of invited talks, with an emphasis on encouraging
engaging technical discussions amongst the participants.</p>

<p>This is the second NetPL workshop, after
<a href="http://2015.ecoop.org/track/netpl-2015-workshop">last year's
workshop</a> at ECOOP. All talks in the previous edition of the workshop are on
