First, data duplication requires huge amount of bandwidth whereas the bandwidth of cross-DR links and the upload/download rates of server interfaces are limited. Second, data transmissions are time sensitive, but the current network cannot complete such tasks in a timely manner. In this work, we present PieBridge, a cross-RD data duplicate transmission platform that accommodates hundreds of TBs of data generated from user applications online data analytics.

However, not only that {\sf .i2p} queries are leaking in the public DNS infrastructure, but also such leakage has various plausible root causes and implications that are different from other related leakage. In this paper, we analyze the leaked {\sf .i2p} requests captured in the A and J root name servers of the public DNS, showing that a large number of queries are observed and outlining various potential directions of addressing such leakage.", "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2960423", "", "", "prog-tuesday");

We leverage on RIPE Atlas, the largest Internet measurement infrastructure, to conduct large scale measurements analysis to provide the feedback to improve LISP technology. The preliminary evaluations show that LISP generally has a reliable performance, compared with the existing Internet.

Because of the ubiquitousness of WiFi infrastructures nowadays, the widely available Received Signal Strength (RSS) information at the WiFi Access points are commonly employed for localization purposes. However, current RSS based DfL systems have one main drawback hindering their real-life applications. That is, the RSS measurements (fingerprints) vary slowly in time even without any change in the environment and frequent updates of RSS at each location lead to a high human labor cost. In this paper, we propose an RSS based low cost DfL system named TafLoc which is able to accurately localize the target over a long time scale. To reduce the amount of human labor cost in updating the RSS fingerprints, TafLoc represents the RSS fingerprints as a matrix which has several unique properties. Based on these properties, we propose a novel fingerprint matrix reconstruction scheme to update the whole fingerprint database with just a few RSS measurements, thus the labor cost is greatly reduced. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of TafLoc, outperforming the state-of-the-art RSS based DfL systems.", "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2959051", "", "", "prog-tuesday");

In response, governments and citizens are increasingly paying attention to the countries that their Internet traffic traverses. In some cases, countries are taking extreme steps, such as building new IXPs and encouraging local interconnection to keep local traffic local. We find that although many of these efforts are extensive, they are often futile, due to the inherent lack of hosting and route diversity for many popular sites. We investigate how the use of overlay network relays and the DNS open resolver infrastructure can prevent traffic from traversing certain jurisdictions.", "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2959081", "", "", "prog-tuesday");

Gill (Stony Brook University)", "Path prediction on the Internet has been a topic of research in the networking community for close to a decade. Applications of path prediction solutions have ranged from optimizing selection of peers in peer- to-peer networks to improving and debugging CDN predictions. Recently, revelations of traffic correlation and surveillance on the Internet have raised the topic of path prediction in the context of network security. Specifically, predicting network paths can allow us to identify and avoid given organizations on network paths (e.g., to avoid traffic correlation attacks in Tor) or to infer the impact of hijacks and interceptions when direct measurements are not available.

In this poster we propose the design and implementation of PathCache which aims to reuse measurement data to estimate AS level paths on the Internet. Unlike similar systems, PathCache does not assume that routing on the Internet is destination based. Instead, we develop an algorithm to compute confidence in paths between ASes. These multiple paths ranked by their confidence values are returned to the user.", "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2959053", "", "", "prog-tuesday");

Han (KAIST)", "Minimizing response times for mobile applications is critical for quality user experience that often impacts the revenue of mobile services. Generalized approaches to accelerated mobile applications (e.g., TCP acceleration, SPDY, compression) are less effective because they do not take account for application specific behaviors. In contrast, application specific approaches build application-specific proxies by leveraging the app-specific protocol behaviors to enable dynamic caching and/or prefetching. However, this is non-trivial because it requires manual analysis of application level protocols and their interactions. Therefore, only a small number of apps enjoyed the benefit.

This paper addresses the problem of scaling the number of applications by automating the process. To this end, we present a framework for mobile application acceleration that leverages automatic protocol analysis to automatically discover opportunities for app acceleration. The framework automatically finds out when and where to prefetch or perform dynamic caching. We present the framework design and a preliminary result that demonstrates its viability.", "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2959049", "", "", "prog-tuesday");

However, current SDN compilers are closely bound to both languages and rules, thus disable the interoperability and compatibility of SDN programs. To solve this problem, we propose to modularize the SDN compiler by leveraging intermediate representation (IR), a common technique for computer compiler design. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Rule (SR) as the first IR for SDN compilers, which is a simple, language-independent, and semantic-preserving representation. We develop two optimizations on the semantic rule to coordinate cross-language programs in a single network and compress the number of compiled rules. We implement a modular compiler prototype with the proposed SR, and demonstrate that RYU programs can run at both OpenFlow and POF network. With synthetic network configurations, we demonstrate that the optimizations on SRs are effective, efficient and scalable.", "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2959061", "", "", "prog-wednesday");

On one hand, ISPs invest to increase downstream speed of access network infrastructure. On the other hand, users cannot achieve perceived quality of experience (QoE). This paper addresses this problem by introducing a system, Conan, which enables content-aware flow scheduling to improve the QoE of users. Conan exploits to satisfy users' requirements in the access network (LAN), which is the performance bottleneck actually. By leveraging the technique of software defined networking (SDN), Conan are able to specify the expected network capacity for different applications. Automatic application identification is deployed at home gateway to improve the scalability, and flexible bandwidth allocation is realized at LAN for specified applications.

As a result, only a few counting functions are defined as mandatory in the OFS specification, although a lot of SDN proposals depend on a detailed states collected by the optional counters in the specification. This fact motivates us to rethink the way to maintain counters in the OFS. We propose a new architecture called CACTI, which only consumes several registers in the fast path and moves the completed counters into the on chip RAM like cache in the slow path processor. Theoretical analysis and experiments on the prototype system demonstrated the efficiency of our architecture: CACTI is capable to achieve the throughput of 29.4-39.7M pps packets per second (pps). No RAM resource is needed any more in the fast path, instead, CACTI consumes only 0.24-0.54\% Look-Up Table and 0.35-0.43\% flip-flops compared with the entire FPGA-based OFS design in the fast path, and the unused CPU cache in the slow path.", "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2959062", "", "", "prog-wednesday");
