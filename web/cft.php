<h1>Call for Tutorials</h1>

<p>
	We seek to extend the SIGCOMM experience by tutorials on selected topics given by renowned scientists and 
	practitioners in their fields. We therefore solicit proposals for full-day or half-day tutorials on topics 
	relevant to the SIGCOMM community. 
</p>
<p>
	Tutorials must cover advanced topics that fit the scope of SIGCOMM and are of current interest to 
	the SIGCOMM community. Tutorials may be lectures, interactive workshops, hands-on training, or any 
	combination of the above. Exploring diverse ways of interacting with the audience is welcome as are 
	cross-disciplinary topics.
</p>
<p>
	Tutorial proposals should be submitted in PDF format, should not exceed three (3) pages in total, and be 
	sent to Raj Jain (jain@wustl.edu). 
</p>
<p>
	Proposals must include: 
	<ul>
		<li>Motivation for the tutorial (why this, why now, why at SIGCOMM?)</li>
		<li>An outline of the tutorial content, including its tentative schedule (over the half-day or full-day)</li>
		<li>The type of tutorial (e.g., lecture vs. hands-on)</li>
		<li>References to previous iterations of the tutorial (if applicable) including their date, venue, topics and number 
			of participants and the motivation for the new proposal</li>
		<li>Requirements for the tutorial room (please note that our capabilities in fulfilling unusual requests are limited)</li>
		<li>Requirements for the attendees (e.g., must bring own laptop or other hardware, familiarity with certain technologies 
			or topics, etc.)</li>
		<li>Any limitations (e.g., number of participants)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Important notes:
	<ul>
		<li>It is recommended that there are up to three speakers for a full-day tutorial and up to two speakers for a half-day tutorial. 
			Tutorial speakers are expected to hold a PhD degree in computer science or a related area. Exceptions will need to get 
			approval from the tutorial co-chair.</li>
		<li>Tutorials will likely be held in parallel with the workshops, i.e., Monday and/or Friday of the SIGCOMM week.</li>
		<li>Upon acceptance of a tutorial proposal, either the tutorial co-chair or the tutorial speakers can request a cancelation 
			of the tutorial if there is clear evidence indicating low attendance of the tutorial by the early registration deadline.</li>
	</ul>
