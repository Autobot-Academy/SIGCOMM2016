<h2>ACM SIGCOMM Harassment Policy</h2>

<p>
	The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to ACM&#39;s aims and goals. These require 
	an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and 
	mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACM is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience 
	for participants at our events and in our programs.
</p>
<p>
	Harassment is unwelcome or hostile behavior, including speech that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with 
	a person's participation or opportunity for participation, in a conference, event or program. Harassment in any form, 
	including but not limited to harassment based on alienage or citizenship, age, color, creed, disability, marital status, 
	military status, national origin, pregnancy, childbirth- and pregnancy-related medical conditions, race, religion, sex, 
	gender, veteran status, or any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is taking place, will 
	not be tolerated. Harassment includes the use of abusive or degrading language,  intimidation, stalking, harassing 
	photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. A response that the participant 
	was &amp;just joking,&amp; or &amp;teasing,&amp; or being &amp;playful,&amp; will not be accepted.
</p>
<p>
	Individuals violating these standards may be sanctioned or excluded from further participation at the discretion of 
	the organizers or responsible committee.
</p>
<p>
	If you believe you have been harassed or notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, 
	you are encouraged to report the incident in confidence to the conference chairs, the SIGCOMM Chair (S. Keshav), 
	or the SIGCOMM Vice-Chair (Renata Teixeira).
