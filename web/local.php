<h2 class=hcls>Salvador, Brazil</h2>

<p>
 Brazil has successfully hosted the World Cup 2014 and will have the Olympics 2016 at Rio de Janeiro. Salvador, the capital of the Northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia, is also known as Brazil's "Capital of Joy". Its first colonial capital, the city is one of the oldest in the Americas. Salvador is notable in Brazil for its cuisine, music and architecture. The African influence in many cultural aspects of the city makes it the centre of Afro-Brazilian culture. The Historic Centre of Salvador, called Pelourinho, is renowned for its Portuguese colonial architecture with historical monuments dating from the 17th to the 19th centuries, and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985. Salvador is located on a small, roughly triangular peninsula that separates All Saints Bay from the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Salvador is home of the Arena Fonte Nova, the city's stadium in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and World Cup 2014.

 Salvador's International Airport provides flights to North America and Europe, directly to Miami, Lisbon, Madrid, Santiago do Chile, and Frankfurt. The airport is located approximately 25km away from the city centre, or around 30-40 minutes. An array of flights to all continents are available from the airports Guarulhos (2h flight, 23-a-day) and Galeao (1h55 flight, 14-a-day). Flights to Salvador from Chicago and London currently take 12h16 and 12h35, respectively, more or less the same that a flight from these places would take to Beijing, for example (according to skyscanner).

 There are at least three hotels that can host SIGCOMM: Bahia Othon Palace (by the sea and close to town and major attractions), Gran Hotel Stella Maris (urban resort, by the sea and close to the airport), and Fiesta Bahia Hotel (close to town and major attractions). All three have rooms for over 1,000 people and side-venues, and have alternative accommodations from 5-star to budget ones. The accommodation rates for a deluxe DBL at these hotels in late August ranges between U$80 and U$160.

 The city has several potential venues for reception and dinners of the event. We envisage the reception being hosted at the hotel itself, by the pool if the weather is nice. Because of its size, the conference banquet would be best hosted either at a club or at the hotel itself. The largest local restaurants, Yemanja and Fogo de Chao, take around 550 people. The best restaurants with local cuisine are for less than 300 people. Coaches would be provided to take attendees safely and timely to the chosen venues and back, plus a few vans for added flexibility.

The required infrastructure for Wi-fi access by the SIGCOMM attendees and the access link to the Internet can be rented locally. However, we envisage the networking support being provided by the Brazilian Academic Network, RNP. It would deploy and manage the Wi-Fi network at the venue and provide the needed access link to Salvador's high-speed metropolitan network. This arrangement is traditional for scientific events hosted in Brazil and could be easily negotiated as a form of sponsorship by RNP.

There is a unique opportunity in organising ACM SIGCOMM at Salvador in 2016: SBRC'16, the 34th Brazilian Computer Networks and Distributed Systems Symposium, will be held on the same city in May, 2016. SBRC is an event more or less the same size and a bit more complex than SIGCOMM: 700-1,000 participants, ~70 papers over 20 Technical Sessions multi-track, 6-8 satellite workshops, tutorials, keynotes and panels. A combined negotiation with venues, catering & transport would be advantageous, allowing lower prices. The organisation would also profit from the experience with SBRC a few months earlier, in charge of Prof. Fabiola Greve, the proposed Local Arrangements Chair. Besides being an attendee of SIGCOMM in previous occasions (first time in 1997, at Cannes), Prof. Barcellos was GC of SBRC in 2010 and has regularly contributed to its organisation.
