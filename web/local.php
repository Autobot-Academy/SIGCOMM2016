SIGCOMM 2016 conference will be hosted at the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.othon.com.br/en/hoteis/hotel-em-salvador/bahia-othon-palace#o-hotel">Bahia Othon Palace</a>: 
<i>"The irresistible charm of Bahia Othon Palace begins with its location: the top of a cliff, facing the turquoise waters of Ondina Beach in Salvador.
And it was this breathtaking view that the architects Paulo Cas&#233; and Luis Accioly, responsible for the project, decided would be enjoyed by all guests, 
making all the windows opened to the only ocean of Salvador. Perfectly integrated with nature, with colonial arches, the hotel offers 
the utmost sophistication and comfort."</i>.

Salvador, the capital of the Northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia, is also known as Brazil's "Capital of Joy". Its first colonial capital, the city 
is one of the oldest in the Americas. Salvador is notable in Brazil for its cuisine, music and architecture. The African influence in many cultural 
aspects of the city makes it the centre of Afro-Brazilian culture. The Historic Centre of Salvador, called Pelourinho, is renowned for its 
Portuguese colonial architecture with historical monuments dating from the 17th to the 19th centuries, and was declared a World Heritage Site by 
UNESCO in 1985. Salvador is located on a small, roughly triangular peninsula that separates All Saints Bay from the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. 
Salvador is home of the Arena Fonte Nova, the city's stadium in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and World Cup 2014.
