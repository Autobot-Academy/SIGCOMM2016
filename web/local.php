<h1>Local Information - Salvador, Brazil</h1>

<p>
Salvador, the capital of the Northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia, is also known as Brazil's "Capital of Joy". Its first colonial capital, the city is one of the oldest in the Americas. Salvador is notable in Brazil for its cuisine, music and architecture. The African influence in many cultural aspects of the city makes it the centre of Afro-Brazilian culture. The Historic Centre of Salvador, called Pelourinho, is renowned for its Portuguese colonial architecture with historical monuments dating from the 17th to the 19th centuries, and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985. Salvador is located on a small, roughly triangular peninsula that separates All Saints Bay from the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Salvador is home of the Arena Fonte Nova, the city's stadium in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and World Cup 2014.
