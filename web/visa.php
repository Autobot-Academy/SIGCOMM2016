<h1>Visa Information</h1>

<p>Visa requirements differ according to each country. Visitors to Brazil are generally required to hold a passport having 2 blank pages, and that will be valid for six months past the date of first entry.</p>

<p>Visitors from <a href="http://www.portalconsular.mre.gov.br/estrangeiros/qgrv-simples-ing-08.04.2016.pdf" rel="external">most countries</a> are not required to obtain visas to enter Brazil, and may stay for periods varying from 7 to 180 days, depending on nationality.</p>

<p>For nationals not eligible for visa exemption, a <b>tourist visa (VITUR)</b> is required. We refer to the <a href="http://cgwashington.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/vitur_%28tourist_visa%29.xml">Consulate General of Brazil in Washington</a> for an overview about visa requirements.</p>

<p>Please note that each Brazilian Consulate has its own visa processing workflow. For specific document requirements, visa application forms, fees and payment methods, please contact your country's <a href="http://www.portalconsular.mre.gov.br/sites-dos-postos/por-ordem-alfabetica" rel="external">diplomatic representation</a>. International registrants should be particularly aware and careful about procedures and timelines (among others), and should plan travel well in advance.</p>

<h2>Visa Inquiries</h2>

<p>All visa inquiries must be handled by ACM Headquarters. Please send your request for a letter in support of a visa application to supportletters@acm.org. Include your name, mailing address, and fax number, as well as the name of the conference you are attending. (Authors of papers/posters should also include the title). Please note that ACM does not issue formal letters of invitation to any of its conferences.

<h2>Letter of Invitation</h2>

<p> As part of the visa application process, you may be required to include a visa 
support letter. To request a visa support letter, register for the conference and then email your request 
to <a href="mailto:tosupportletters@acm.org">supportletters@acm.org</a>, 
and include<ol><li>Your name as it appears on your passport</li>
<li>Your current postal mailing address</li>
<li>The name of the conference you wish to attend (&#8220;ACM SIGCOMM 2016&#8221;)</li>
<li>Your Registration Confirmation Number</li>
<li>If you have any papers accepted for the conference, please provide the title and indicate whether you are the &#8220;sole author&#8221; or a &#8220;co-author&#8221;</li></ol></p>

<p>Visa support letters are answered in the order they are received. You will receive a PDF letter by email within 4-5 business days. Please note we do not fax visa support letters. The PDF serves as a signed electronic version of the original letter which will be mailed to your current mailing address. If you do not receive the letter by post mail on time for your visa appointment, please print out your PDF letter and take it with you.</p>

<p>Please note that Letter of Invitation will only be sent to participants
who have registered and paid for the Conference. Should participants
withdraw from the conference after the issue of Letter of Invitation,
the consulate will be notified of the withdrawal accordingly.</p>
