<h2>N2Women Young Researcher Fellowship</h2>

<p>N2Women is pleased to announce the continuation of our N2Women Young Researcher 
Fellowship awards. N2Women considers you a young researcher if you are currently 
a student, working as a post-doc, or in the 1st or 2nd year of your new research 
career. These awards will partially cover a young researcherâ€™s travel cost 
(up to $1000) to a meeting where an N2Women event will be held. In exchange, 
the young researcher must help organize the N2Women meeting. The benefit of doing 
the organization, in addition to the travel funds, is for the young researcher 
to connect with the organizers of the conference who are, typically, leaders in 
the research field. We will arrange for a faculty or research member of N2Women 
to assist/mentor the young researcher in this task.

<p>
Support for these N2Women Young Researcher Fellowship awards has been
generously provided by ACM SIGMOBILE, ACM SIGCOMM, IEEE ComSoc, IEEE CS TCCC,
Microsoft Research, HP Labs and Google Research.
