<h1>Pubs &amp; Restaurants</h1>

<p>In the map below you may find some pubs &amp; restaurants near the conference venue, and also some special suggestions (more distant from the venue). August is still a low season month in Florian&oacute;polis (since it is winter time), and some places may be closed on some days. It is generally a good idea to call ahead for reservations.</p>
