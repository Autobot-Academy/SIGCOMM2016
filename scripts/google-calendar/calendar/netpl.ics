DESCRIPTION:Talks: \n\n* Title: P4FPGA: High-Level Synthesis for Networkin
 g – Speaker(s): Han Wang\, Ki Suh Lee\, Vishal Shrivastav\, Hakim Weathe
 rspoon (Cornell University)\n\n* Keynote Title:\nUpdate on P4: Where are w
 e now\, and where are we heading toward?\n\nSpeaker:\nChanghoon Kim (Baref
 oot Networks)\n\nAbstract:\nSince its original publication\, P4 has been d
 rawing significant attention from both networking industry and research co
 mmunity. Motivated by that\, industry experts and research groups have for
 med the P4 Language Consortium and have been nurturing the language to pro
 duce an industry-wide common data-plane programming framework. In this tal
 k I will summarize what has happened to P4 since its original publication\
 , what kinds of activities are currently ongoing\, who in the field of net
 working can benefit from P4 and how\, what kinds of novel networking appli
 cations are being developed in P4\, how we expect the language and its ass
 ociated development tools to evolve\, and what kinds of interesting resear
 ch problems arise as data-plane programmability becomes commonplace.\n\nSp
 eaker Bio:\nChanghoon Kim is Director of System Architecture at Barefoot N
 etworks and is working actively for the P4 Language Consortium (P4.org) as
  a co-chair of the P4 Design Working Group. Before getting involved with P
 4.org and Barefoot\, he worked at Windows Azure\, Microsoft’s cloud-serv
 ice division\, and led engineering and research projects on the architectu
 re\, performance\, and management of datacenter networks. Chang is interes
 ted in programmable network dataplane\, network monitoring and diagnostics
 \, network verification\, self-programming/configuring networks\, and debu
 gging and diagnosis of large-scale distributed systems. Chang received Ph.
 D. from Princeton University. Many of his research contributions — inclu
 ding VL2\, Seawall\, EyeQ\, Ananta\, and SEATTLE — are adopted in large 
 production networks.\n\n* Keynote Title:\nThe Next 700 Network Programming
  Languages\n\nSpeaker:\nNate Foster (Cornell University)\n\nAbstract:\nSpe
 cification and verification of computer networks has become a reality in r
 ecent years\, with the emergence of domain-specific programming languages 
 and automated verification tools. But the design of these languages and to
 ols has been largely ad hoc\, driven more by the needs of applications and
  the capabilities of hardware than by any foundational principles. This ta
 lk will present NetKAT\, a language for programming networks based on a we
 ll-studied mathematical foundation\, Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT). The 
 talk will describe the design of the language\, its semantic underpinnings
 \, and extensions with features to support stateful and probabilistic prog
 ramming.<br/><br/>NetKAT is joint work with colleagues at Cornell\, Facebo
 ok\, Inhabited Type\, Princeton\, Samsung\, UCL\, and UMass Amherst.\n\nSp
 eaker Bio:\nNate Foster is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at C
 ornell University. The goal of his search is developing programming langua
 ges and tools for building reliable systems. He received a PhD in Computer
  Science from theUniversity of Pennsylvania in 2009\, an MPhil in History 
 and Philosophy of Science from Cambridge University in 2008\, and a BA in 
 Computer Science from Williams College in 2001. His awards include a Sloan
  Research Fellowship\, an NSF CAREER Award\, a Most Influential POPL Paper
  Award\, a Tien &#39\;72 Teaching Award\, a Google Research Award\, a Yaho
 o! Academic Career Enhancement Award\, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff
  Award.\n\n

 \n\n* Keynote Title:\nTemporal NetKAT\n\nSpeaker:\nDavid Walker (Princeton
  University)\n\nAbstract:\nOver the past 5-10 years\, the rise of software
 -defined networking (SDN) has inspired a wide range of new systems\, libra
 ries\, hypervisors and languages for programming\, monitoring\, and debugg
 ing network behavior. Oftentimes\, these systems are disjoint—one langua
 ge for programming and another for verification\, and yet another for run-
 time monitoring and debugging. In this paper\, we present a new\, unified 
 framework\, called Temporal NetKAT\, capable of facilitating all of these 
 tasks at once. As its name suggests\, Temporal NetKAT is the synthesis of 
 two formal theories: past-time (finite trace) linear temporal logic and (n
 etwork) Kleene Algebra with Tests. Temporal predicates allow programmers t
 o write down concise properties of a packet’s path through the network a
 nd to make dynamic packet-forwarding\, access control or debugging decisio
 ns on that basis. In addition to being useful for programming\, the combin
 ed equational theory of LTL and NetKAT facilitates proofs of path-based co
 rrectness properties. Using new\, general\, proof techniques\, we show tha
 t the equational semantics is sound with respect to the denotational seman
 tics\, and\, for a class of programs we call network-wide programs\, compl
 ete. We have also implemented a compiler for temporal NetKAT\, evaluated i
 ts performance on a range of benchmarks\, and studied the effectiveness of
  several optimizations.<br/><br/>This is joint work with Ryan Beckett and 
 Michael Greenberg.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDavid Walker is a Professor of Compute
 r Science at Princeton University. He received his B.Sc. from Queen's Univ
 ersity\, Canada in 1995 and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell Uni
 versity in 2001. His research interests include programming language theor
 y\, design and implementation of all kinds. He is especially interested in
  type systems and the development of new domain-specific programming langu
 ages. He won an NSF Career award in 2003 and Alfred Sloan Fellowship in 20
 04. In 2007\, with his students and colleagues at Princeton\, he won the P
 LDI best paper award for the paper entitled Fault-Tolerant Typed Assembly 
 Language. In 2008\, his paper From System F to Typed Assembly Language\, c
 o-authored with Greg Morrisett\, Karl Crary and Neal Glew\, won a 10-year 
 retrospective award for most influential POPL 1998 paper. In 2013\, with h
 is students and colleagues at Princeton and Cornell\, he won the NSDI comm
 unity award for his paper on Composing Software-Defined Networks. He serve
 d as an associate editor for ACM TOPLAS from 2007-2015\, as the Program Ch
 air for POPL 2015\, and won the ACM SIGPLAN Robin Milner Young Researcher 
 Award in 2015.\n\n* Keynote Title:\nNEMO Engine\, A Model Driven Compiler 
 to Execute User&#39\;s Intent and Manage Service Lifecycle by Multi Layer 
 State Machine\n\nSpeaker:\nYinben Xia (Huawei Technologies)\n\nAbstract:\n
 In last year&#39\;s NetPL workshop\, I introduced an intent oriented netwo
 rk service programming language - NEMO. This time\, I will introduce NEMO&
 #39\;s model driven compiler\, which compiles intent language to real netw
 ork executable interface. Second\, I will introduce a multi layer state ma
 chine engine in NEMO compiler\, which will handle various changes from equ
 ipments\, requirement or governance policy. This engine provides an automa
 tic change management capability for whole service lifecycle. In the last\
 , I will update NEMO&#39\;s open source implementation progress.\n\nSpeake
 r Bio:\nDr. Yinben Xia is a senior staff researcher within Huawei&#39\;s n
 etwork research department from 2008. He dedicated his research effort in 
 network architecture and SDN technologies. In recent two years\, he lead a
  team to design and developer a NaaS (Network as a Service) programming la
 nguage (NEMO Project). He owns 15 patents in related domain. He is leading
  a team to carry out SDN/NEMO research in Beijing. Before joining Huawei\,
  Dr. Xia worked at IBM China Research Lab for 4 years after he got PH.D fr
 om Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\n* Keynote Title:
 \nInteractive Query for Dynamic Network Analytics\n\nSpeaker:\nHaoyu Song 
 (Huawei Technologies)\n\nAbstract:\nNetwork data plane needs to be interac
 tively programmed in order to support Dynamic Network Analytics (DNA). We 
 envision the high level DNA applications can be break down into a set of q
 ueries and the queries can be further compiled into incremental configurat
 ions to the data plane. We emphasize the need to define standard DNA APIs 
 and/or query language for DNA system.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nHaoyu Song is a pri
 ncipal architect at Huawei Technologies. He is a leading researcher on SDN
  programmable data plane. His current research interests span all aspects 
 of the SDN/NFV ecosystem. He was a researcher at Bell Labs\, Alcatel-Lucen
 t before joining Huawei. He hold a doctoral degree in computer engineering
  from Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n
