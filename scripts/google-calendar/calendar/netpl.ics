DESCRIPTION:Chair(s): Marco Canini (KAUST\, KSA)\n\n* Keynote Title:\nUpda
 te on P4: Where are we now\, and where are we heading toward?\n\nSpeaker:\
 nChanghoon Kim (Barefoot Networks)\n\nAbstract:\nSince its original public
 ation\, P4 has been drawing significant attention from both networking ind
 ustry and research community. Motivated by that\, industry experts and res
 earch groups have formed the P4 Language Consortium and have been nurturin
 g the language to produce an industry-wide common data-plane programming f
 ramework. In this talk I will summarize what has happened to P4 since its 
 original publication\, what kinds of activities are currently ongoing\, wh
 o in the field of networking can benefit from P4 and how\, what kinds of n
 ovel networking applications are being developed in P4\, how we expect the
  language and its associated development tools to evolve\, and what kinds 
 of interesting research problems arise as data-plane programmability becom
 es commonplace.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nChanghoon Kim is Director of System Archi
 tecture at Barefoot Networks and is working actively for the P4 Language C
 onsortium (P4.org) as a co-chair of the P4 Design Working Group. Before ge
 tting involved with P4.org and Barefoot\, he worked at Windows Azure\, Mic
 rosoft’s cloud-service division\, and led engineering and research proje
 cts on the architecture\, performance\, and management of datacenter netwo
 rks. Chang is interested in programmable network dataplane\, network monit
 oring and diagnostics\, network verification\, self-programming/configurin
 g networks\, and debugging and diagnosis of large-scale distributed system
 s. Chang received Ph.D. from Princeton University. Many of his research co
 ntributions — including VL2\, Seawall\, EyeQ\, Ananta\, and SEATTLE — 
 are adopted in large production networks.\n\n* Keynote Title:\nP4FPGA: Hig
 h-Level Synthesis for Networking\n\nSpeaker:\nHan Wang\, Ki Suh Lee\, Vish
 al Shrivastav\, Hakim Weatherspoon (Cornell University)\n\nAbstract:\nFiel
 d-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are often used to prototype custom pack
 et processing algorithms. FPGAs are appealing because they balance the spe
 ed of hardware and the flexibility of software. From a programming languag
 e perspective\, domain specific languages (DSLs)\, such as P4and PX\, are 
 emerging to allow succinct expression of packet processing algorithms. Wha
 t remains difficult\, is the process to translate high level DSLs to low-l
 evel hardware description language\, such as Verilog\, in order to generat
 e FPGA firmware. This talk presents P4FPGA\, an open-source framework that
  enables compilation of high-level P4 language to FPGA firmware. Our frame
 work translates a given P4 program through a number of intermediate steps.
  It leverages existing intermediate representations of a P4 program\,and g
 enerates corresponding Bluespec System Verilog (BSV) for simulation and sy
 nthesis. In addition\, we provide runtime support for a packet processing 
 algorithm to enable communication with network interfaces and host OS thro
 ugh PCI express bus. We have implemented a number of P4 applications on to
 p of our framework to show its general applicability.\n\n* Keynote Title:\
 nThe Next 700 Network Programming Languages\n\nSpeaker:\nNate Foster (Corn
 ell University)\n\nAbstract:\nSpecification and verification of computer n
 etworks has become a reality in recent years\, with the emergence of domai
 n-specific programming languages and automated verification tools. But the
  design of these languages and tools has been largely ad hoc\, driven more
  by the needs of applications and the capabilities of hardware than by any
  foundational principles. This talk will present NetKAT\, a language for p
 rogramming networks based on a well-studied mathematical foundation\, Klee
 ne Algebra with Tests (KAT). The talk will describe the design of the lang
 uage\, its semantic underpinnings\, and extensions with features to suppor
 t stateful and probabilistic programming.<br/><br/>NetKAT is joint work wi
 th colleagues at Cornell\, Facebook\, Inhabited Type\, Princeton\, Samsung
 \, UCL\, and UMass Amherst.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nNate Foster is an Assistant P
 rofessor of Computer Science at Cornell University. The goal of his search
  is developing programming languages and tools for building reliable syste
 ms. He received a PhD in Computer Science from theUniversity of Pennsylvan
 ia in 2009\, an MPhil in History and Philosophy of Science from Cambridge 
 University in 2008\, and a BA in Computer Science from Williams College in
  2001. His awards include a Sloan Research Fellowship\, an NSF CAREER Awar
 d\, a Most Influential POPL Paper Award\, a Tien &#39\;72 Teaching Award\,
  a Google Research Award\, a Yahoo! Academic Career Enhancement Award\, an

DESCRIPTION:Chair(s): Nik Sultana (University of Cambridge)\n\n* Keynote T
 itle:\nTemporal NetKAT\n\nSpeaker:\nDavid Walker (Princeton University)\n\
 nAbstract:\nOver the past 5-10 years\, the rise of software-defined networ
 king (SDN) has inspired a wide range of new systems\, libraries\, hypervis
 ors and languages for programming\, monitoring\, and debugging network beh
 avior. Oftentimes\, these systems are disjoint—one language for programm
 ing and another for verification\, and yet another for run-time monitoring
  and debugging. In this paper\, we present a new\, unified framework\, cal
 led Temporal NetKAT\, capable of facilitating all of these tasks at once. 
 As its name suggests\, Temporal NetKAT is the synthesis of two formal theo
 ries: past-time (finite trace) linear temporal logic and (network) Kleene 
 Algebra with Tests. Temporal predicates allow programmers to write down co
 ncise properties of a packet’s path through the network and to make dyna
 mic packet-forwarding\, access control or debugging decisions on that basi
 s. In addition to being useful for programming\, the combined equational t
 heory of LTL and NetKAT facilitates proofs of path-based correctness prope
 rties. Using new\, general\, proof techniques\, we show that the equationa
 l semantics is sound with respect to the denotational semantics\, and\, fo
 r a class of programs we call network-wide programs\, complete. We have al
 so implemented a compiler for temporal NetKAT\, evaluated its performance 
 on a range of benchmarks\, and studied the effectiveness of several optimi
 zations.<br/><br/>This is joint work with Ryan Beckett and Michael Greenbe
 rg.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDavid Walker is a Professor of Computer Science at Pr
 inceton University. He received his B.Sc. from Queen's University\, Canada

 n\n* Keynote Title:\nTowards Correct-by-Construction SDN\n\nSpeaker:\nLeon
 id Ryzhyk (Samsung Research America)\, Nikolaj Bjorner (Microsoft Research
 )\, Marco Canini (Université catholique de Louvain\, Belgium)\, Jean-Bapt
 iste Jeannin\, Nina Narodytska\, Cole Schlesinger\, Douglas B. Terry (Sams
 ung Research America)\, George Varghese (Microsoft Research)\n\nAbstract:\
 nHigh-level SDN languages raise the level of abstraction in SDN programmin
 g from managing individual switches to programming network-wide policies. 
 In this talk\, we present Cocoon (for Correct by Construction Networking)\
 , an SDN programming language designed around the idea of iterative refine
 ment. The network programmer starts with a high-level functional descripti
 on of the desired network behavior\, focusing on the service the network s
 hould provide to each packet\, as opposed to how this service is implement
 ed within the network fabric. The programmer then iteratively refines the 
 top-level specification\, adding details of the topology\, routing\, fault
  recovery\, etc.\, until reaching a level of detail sufficient for the Coc
 oon compiler to generate an SDN application that manages network switches 
 via the southbound interface.\n\n* Keynote Title:\n(Cancelled due to fligh
 t issues) <s>NEMO Engine\, A Model Driven Compiler to Execute User&#39\;s 
 Intent and Manage Service Lifecycle by Multi Layer State Machine</s>\n\nSp
 eaker:\nYinben Xia (Huawei Technologies)\n\nAbstract:\nIn last year&#39\;s
  NetPL workshop\, I introduced an intent oriented network service programm
 ing language - NEMO. This time\, I will introduce NEMO&#39\;s model driven
  compiler\, which compiles intent language to real network executable inte
 rface. Second\, I will introduce a multi layer state machine engine in NEM
 O compiler\, which will handle various changes from equipments\, requireme
 nt or governance policy. This engine provides an automatic change manageme
 nt capability for whole service lifecycle. In the last\, I will update NEM
 O&#39\;s open source implementation progress.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDr. Yinben 
 Xia is a senior staff researcher within Huawei&#39\;s network research dep
 artment from 2008. He dedicated his research effort in network architectur
 e and SDN technologies. In recent two years\, he lead a team to design and
  developer a NaaS (Network as a Service) programming language (NEMO Projec
 t). He owns 15 patents in related domain. He is leading a team to carry ou
 t SDN/NEMO research in Beijing. Before joining Huawei\, Dr. Xia worked at 
 IBM China Research Lab for 4 years after he got PH.D from Beijing Universi
 ty of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\n* Keynote Title:\n(Cancelled due to
  flight issues) <s>Interactive Query for Dynamic Network Analytics</s>\n\n
 Speaker:\nHaoyu Song (Huawei Technologies)\n\nAbstract:\nNetwork data plan
 e needs to be interactively programmed in order to support Dynamic Network
  Analytics (DNA). We envision the high level DNA applications can be break
  down into a set of queries and the queries can be further compiled into i
 ncremental configurations to the data plane. We emphasize the need to defi
 ne standard DNA APIs and/or query language for DNA system.\n\nSpeaker Bio:
