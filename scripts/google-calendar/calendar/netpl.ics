 Network Programming Languages\n\nSpeaker:\nNate Foster (Cornell University
 )\n\nAbstract:\nSpecification and verification of computer networks has be
 come a reality in recent years\, with the emergence of domain-specific pro
 gramming languages and automated verification tools. But the design of the
 se languages and tools has been largely ad hoc\, driven more by the needs 
 of applications and the capabilities of hardware than by any foundational 
 principles. This talk will present NetKAT\, a language for programming net
 works based on a well-studied mathematical foundation\, Kleene Algebra wit
 h Tests (KAT). The talk will describe the design of the language\, its sem
 antic underpinnings\, and extensions with features to support stateful and
  probabilistic programming.<br/><br/>NetKAT is joint work with colleagues 
 at Cornell\, Facebook\, Inhabited Type\, Princeton\, Samsung\, UCL\, and U
 Mass Amherst.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nNate Foster is an Assistant Professor of Co
 mputer Science at Cornell University. The goal of his search is developing
  programming languages and tools for building reliable systems. He receive
 d a PhD in Computer Science from theUniversity of Pennsylvania in 2009\, a
 n MPhil in History and Philosophy of Science from Cambridge University in 
 2008\, and a BA in Computer Science from Williams College in 2001. His awa
 rds include a Sloan Research Fellowship\, an NSF CAREER Award\, a Most Inf
 luential POPL Paper Award\, a Tien &#39\;72 Teaching Award\, a Google Rese
 arch Award\, a Yahoo! Academic Career Enhancement Award\, and the Morris a
 nd Dorothy Rubinoff Award.\n\n* Keynote Title:\nSymmetries and Surgeries f
 or Network Verification and Quantitative Network Analysis\n\nSpeaker:\nNik
 olaj Bjorner (Microsoft Research)\n\nAbstract:\nPacket switched networks b
 uild in redundancies that enable scale and fault tolerance. Such redundanc
 ies are conveniently implemented by placing routers in symmetric or near s
 ymmetric configurations. The symmetries are also present at the level of r
 outing tables. When it comes to checking properties of such networks\, whe
 ther it being reachability or quantitative properties\, such as congestion
 \, the gain in recognizing such symmetries can be dramatic. Reducing the n
 etworks to their asymmetric core enables scaling analysis by order of magn
 itudes compared to a straight-forward analysis. In this talk I describe ou
 r efforts around extracting and exploiting symmetries and bisimulations in
  data-center and wide-area networks. In this quest we develop algorithms t
 hat find bisimilar routing states that exploit properties of packet switch
 ed routers. We also introduce a data-structure (ddNF) for extracting sets 
 of IP headers that are treated equivalently from the point of view of rout
 ing tables. We then develop a notion of bisimulations to quantitative sett
 ings.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nNikolaj Bjorner is a Principal Researcher at Micros
 oft Research\, Redmond\, working in the area of Automated Theorem Proving 
 and Software Engineering. His current main line of work is around the stat
 e-of-the art theorem prover Z3\, which is used as a foundation of several 
 software engineering tools. Z3 is developed by Leonardo de Moura\, Nikolaj
  Bjorner and Christoph Wintersteiger. Z3 received the 2015 ACM SIGPLAN Sof
 tware System’s award. Previously\, he designed the DFSR\, Distributed Fi
 le System - Replication\, shipped with Windows Server since 2005 and befor
 e that worked on distributed file sharing systems at a startup XDegrees\, 
 and program synthesis and transformation systems at the Kestrel Institute.
  He received his Master’s and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Sta
 nford University\, and spent the first three years of university at DTU an
 d DIKU.\n\n* Keynote Title:\nTemporal NetKAT\n\nSpeaker:\nDavid Walker (Pr
 inceton University)\n\nAbstract:\nOver the past 5-10 years\, the rise of s
 oftware-defined networking (SDN) has inspired a wide range of new systems\
 , libraries\, hypervisors and languages for programming\, monitoring\, and
  debugging network behavior. Oftentimes\, these systems are disjoint—one
  language for programming and another for verification\, and yet another f
 or run-time monitoring and debugging. In this paper\, we present a new\, u
 nified framework\, called Temporal NetKAT\, capable of facilitating all of
  these tasks at once. As its name suggests\, Temporal NetKAT is the synthe
 sis of two formal theories: past-time (finite trace) linear temporal logic
  and (network) Kleene Algebra with Tests. Temporal predicates allow progra
 mmers to write down concise properties of a packet’s path through the ne
 twork and to make dynamic packet-forwarding\, access control or debugging 
 decisions on that basis. In addition to being useful for programming\, the
  combined equational theory of LTL and NetKAT facilitates proofs of path-b
 ased correctness properties. Using new\, general\, proof techniques\, we s
 how that the equational semantics is sound with respect to the denotationa
 l semantics\, and\, for a class of programs we call network-wide programs\
 , complete. We have also implemented a compiler for temporal NetKAT\, eval
 uated its performance on a range of benchmarks\, and studied the effective
 ness of several optimizations.<br/><br/>This is joint work with Ryan Becke
 tt and Michael Greenberg.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDavid Walker is a Professor of 
 Computer Science at Princeton University. He received his B.Sc. from Queen
 's University\, Canada in 1995 and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Corn
 ell University in 2001. His research interests include programming languag
 e theory\, design and implementation of all kinds. He is especially intere
 sted in type systems and the development of new domain-specific programmin
 g languages. He won an NSF Career award in 2003 and Alfred Sloan Fellowshi
 p in 2004. In 2007\, with his students and colleagues at Princeton\, he wo
 n the PLDI best paper award for the paper entitled Fault-Tolerant Typed As
 sembly Language. In 2008\, his paper From System F to Typed Assembly Langu
 age\, co-authored with Greg Morrisett\, Karl Crary and Neal Glew\, won a 1
 0-year retrospective award for most influential POPL 1998 paper. In 2013\,
  with his students and colleagues at Princeton and Cornell\, he won the NS
 DI community award for his paper on Composing Software-Defined Networks. H
 e served as an associate editor for ACM TOPLAS from 2007-2015\, as the Pro
 gram Chair for POPL 2015\, and won the ACM SIGPLAN Robin Milner Young Rese
 archer Award in 2015.\n\n* Keynote Title:\nInteractive Query for Dynamic N
 etwork Analytics\n\nSpeaker:\nHaoyu Song (Huawei Technologies)\n\nAbstract
 :\nNetwork data plane needs to be interactively programmed in order to sup
 port Dynamic Network Analytics (DNA). We envision the high level DNA appli
 cations can be break down into a set of queries and the queries can be fur
 ther compiled into incremental configurations to the data plane. We emphas
 ize the need to define standard DNA APIs and/or query language for DNA sys
 tem.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nHaoyu Song is a principal architect at Huawei Techno
 logies. He is a leading researcher on SDN programmable data plane. His cur
 rent research interests span all aspects of the SDN/NFV ecosystem. He was 
 a researcher at Bell Labs\, Alcatel-Lucent before joining Huawei. He hold 
 a doctoral degree in computer engineering from Washington University in St
 . Louis.\n\n* Keynote Title:\nVerifying Reachability in Networks with Muta
 ble Datapaths\n\nSpeaker:\nAurojit Panda (UC Berkeley)\n\nAbstract:\nRecen
 t work has made great progress in verifying the forwarding correctness of 
 networks. However\, these approaches cannot be used to verify networks con
 taining middleboxes\, such as caches and firewalls\, whose forwarding beha
 vior depends on previously observed traffic. We explore how to verify reac
 hability properties for networks that include such &quot\;mutable datapath
 &quot\; elements. We want our verification results to hold not just for th
 e given network\, but also in the presence of failures. The main challenge
  lies in scaling the approach to handle large and complicated networks\, W
 e address by developing and leveraging the concept of slices\, which allow
  network-wide verification to only require analyzing small portions of the
  network. We show that with slices the time required to verify an invarian
 t on many production networks is independent of the size of the network it
 self.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nAurojit Panda is a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley adv
 ised by Scott Shenker. His research largely focuses on how to simplify dev
 eloping and deploying new network services.\n\n* Keynote Title:\nNEMO Engi
 ne\, A Model Driven Compiler to Execute User&#39\;s Intent and Manage Serv
 ice Lifecycle by Multi Layer State Machine\n\nSpeaker:\nYinben Xia (Huawei
  Technologies)\n\nAbstract:\nIn last year&#39\;s NetPL workshop\, I introd
 uced an intent oriented network service programming language - NEMO. This 
 time\, I will introduce NEMO&#39\;s model driven compiler\, which compiles
  intent language to real network executable interface. Second\, I will int
 roduce a multi layer state machine engine in NEMO compiler\, which will ha
 ndle various changes from equipments\, requirement or governance policy. T
 his engine provides an automatic change management capability for whole se
 rvice lifecycle. In the last\, I will update NEMO&#39\;s open source imple
 mentation progress.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDr. Yinben Xia is a senior staff rese
 archer within Huawei&#39\;s network research department from 2008. He dedi
 cated his research effort in network architecture and SDN technologies. In
  recent two years\, he lead a team to design and developer a NaaS (Network
  as a Service) programming language (NEMO Project). He owns 15 patents in 
 related domain. He is leading a team to carry out SDN/NEMO research in Bei
 jing. Before joining Huawei\, Dr. Xia worked at IBM China Research Lab for
  4 years after he got PH.D from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astr
 onautics.\n\n
