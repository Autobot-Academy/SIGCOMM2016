DESCRIPTION:* Keynote Title:\nUpdate on P4: Where are we now\, and where a
 re we heading toward?\n\nSpeaker:\nChanghoon Kim (Barefoot Networks)\n\nAb
 stract:\nSince its original publication\, P4 has been drawing significant 
 attention from both networking industry and research community. Motivated 
 by that\, industry experts and research groups have formed the P4 Language
  Consortium and have been nurturing the language to produce an industry-wi
 de common data-plane programming framework. In this talk I will summarize 
 what has happened to P4 since its original publication\, what kinds of act
 ivities are currently ongoing\, who in the field of networking can benefit
  from P4 and how\, what kinds of novel networking applications are being d
 eveloped in P4\, how we expect the language and its associated development
  tools to evolve\, and what kinds of interesting research problems arise a
 s data-plane programmability becomes commonplace.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nChangho
 on Kim is Director of System Architecture at Barefoot Networks and is work
 ing actively for the P4 Language Consortium (P4.org) as a co-chair of the 
 P4 Design Working Group. Before getting involved with P4.org and Barefoot\
 , he worked at Windows Azure\, Microsoft’s cloud-service division\, and 
 led engineering and research projects on the architecture\, performance\, 
 and management of datacenter networks. Chang is interested in programmable
  network dataplane\, network monitoring and diagnostics\, network verifica
 tion\, self-programming/configuring networks\, and debugging and diagnosis
  of large-scale distributed systems. Chang received Ph.D. from Princeton U
 niversity. Many of his research contributions — including VL2\, Seawall\
 , EyeQ\, Ananta\, and SEATTLE — are adopted in large production networks
 .\n\n* Keynote Title:\nP4FPGA: High-Level Synthesis for Networking\n\nSpea
 ker:\nHan Wang\, Ki Suh Lee\, Vishal Shrivastav\, Hakim Weatherspoon (Corn
 ell University)\n\nAbstract:\nField-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are o
 ften used to prototype custom packet processing algorithms. FPGAs are appe
 aling because they balance the speed of hardware and the flexibility of so
 ftware. From a programming language perspective\, domain specific language
 s (DSLs)\, such as P4and PX\, are emerging to allow succinct expression of
  packet processing algorithms. What remains difficult\, is the process to 
 translate high level DSLs to low-level hardware description language\, suc
 h as Verilog\, in order to generate FPGA firmware. This talk presents P4FP
 GA\, an open-source framework that enables compilation of high-level P4 la
 nguage to FPGA firmware. Our framework translates a given P4 program throu
 gh a number of intermediate steps. It leverages existing intermediate repr
 esentations of a P4 program\,and generates corresponding Bluespec System V
 erilog (BSV) for simulation and synthesis. In addition\, we provide runtim
 e support for a packet processing algorithm to enable communication with n
 etwork interfaces and host OS through PCI express bus. We have implemented
  a number of P4 applications on top of our framework to show its general a
 pplicability.\n\n* Keynote Title:\nThe Next 700 Network Programming Langua
 ges\n\nSpeaker:\nNate Foster (Cornell University)\n\nAbstract:\nSpecificat
 ion and verification of computer networks has become a reality in recent y
 ears\, with the emergence of domain-specific programming languages and aut
 omated verification tools. But the design of these languages and tools has
  been largely ad hoc\, driven more by the needs of applications and the ca
 pabilities of hardware than by any foundational principles. This talk will
  present NetKAT\, a language for programming networks based on a well-stud
 ied mathematical foundation\, Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT). The talk wi
 ll describe the design of the language\, its semantic underpinnings\, and 
 extensions with features to support stateful and probabilistic programming
 .<br/><br/>NetKAT is joint work with colleagues at Cornell\, Facebook\, In
 habited Type\, Princeton\, Samsung\, UCL\, and UMass Amherst.\n\nSpeaker B
 io:\nNate Foster is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Cornell 
 University. The goal of his search is developing programming languages and
  tools for building reliable systems. He received a PhD in Computer Scienc
 e from theUniversity of Pennsylvania in 2009\, an MPhil in History and Phi
 losophy of Science from Cambridge University in 2008\, and a BA in Compute
 r Science from Williams College in 2001. His awards include a Sloan Resear
 ch Fellowship\, an NSF CAREER Award\, a Most Influential POPL Paper Award\
 , a Tien &#39\;72 Teaching Award\, a Google Research Award\, a Yahoo! Acad
 emic Career Enhancement Award\, and the Morris and Dorothy Rubinoff Award.

DESCRIPTION:* Keynote Title:\nTemporal NetKAT\n\nSpeaker:\nDavid Walker (P
 rinceton University)\n\nAbstract:\nOver the past 5-10 years\, the rise of 
 software-defined networking (SDN) has inspired a wide range of new systems
 \, libraries\, hypervisors and languages for programming\, monitoring\, an
 d debugging network behavior. Oftentimes\, these systems are disjoint—on
 e language for programming and another for verification\, and yet another 
 for run-time monitoring and debugging. In this paper\, we present a new\, 
 unified framework\, called Temporal NetKAT\, capable of facilitating all o
 f these tasks at once. As its name suggests\, Temporal NetKAT is the synth
 esis of two formal theories: past-time (finite trace) linear temporal logi
 c and (network) Kleene Algebra with Tests. Temporal predicates allow progr
 ammers to write down concise properties of a packet’s path through the n
 etwork and to make dynamic packet-forwarding\, access control or debugging
  decisions on that basis. In addition to being useful for programming\, th
 e combined equational theory of LTL and NetKAT facilitates proofs of path-
 based correctness properties. Using new\, general\, proof techniques\, we 
 show that the equational semantics is sound with respect to the denotation
 al semantics\, and\, for a class of programs we call network-wide programs
 \, complete. We have also implemented a compiler for temporal NetKAT\, eva
 luated its performance on a range of benchmarks\, and studied the effectiv
 eness of several optimizations.<br/><br/>This is joint work with Ryan Beck
 ett and Michael Greenberg.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDavid Walker is a Professor of
  Computer Science at Princeton University. He received his B.Sc. from Quee
 n's University\, Canada in 1995 and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cor
 nell University in 2001. His research interests include programming langua
 ge theory\, design and implementation of all kinds. He is especially inter
 ested in type systems and the development of new domain-specific programmi
 ng languages. He won an NSF Career award in 2003 and Alfred Sloan Fellowsh
 ip in 2004. In 2007\, with his students and colleagues at Princeton\, he w
 on the PLDI best paper award for the paper entitled Fault-Tolerant Typed A
 ssembly Language. In 2008\, his paper From System F to Typed Assembly Lang
 uage\, co-authored with Greg Morrisett\, Karl Crary and Neal Glew\, won a 
 10-year retrospective award for most influential POPL 1998 paper. In 2013\
 , with his students and colleagues at Princeton and Cornell\, he won the N
 SDI community award for his paper on Composing Software-Defined Networks.

 n SDN\n\nSpeaker:\nLeonid Ryzhyk (Samsung Research America)\, Nikolaj Bjor
 ner (Microsoft Research)\, Marco Canini (Université catholique de Louvain
 \, Belgium)\, Jean-Baptiste Jeannin\, Nina Narodytska\, Cole Schlesinger\,
  Douglas B. Terry (Samsung Research America)\, George Varghese (Microsoft 
 Research)\n\nAbstract:\nHigh-level SDN languages raise the level of abstra
 ction in SDN programming from managing individual switches to programming 
 network-wide policies. In this talk\, we present Cocoon (for Correct by Co
 nstruction Networking)\, an SDN programming language designed around the i
 dea of iterative refinement. The network programmer starts with a high-lev
 el functional description of the desired network behavior\, focusing on th
 e service the network should provide to each packet\, as opposed to how th
 is service is implemented within the network fabric. The programmer then i
 teratively refines the top-level specification\, adding details of the top
 ology\, routing\, fault recovery\, etc.\, until reaching a level of detail
  sufficient for the Cocoon compiler to generate an SDN application that ma
 nages network switches via the southbound interface.\n\n* Keynote Title:\n
 NEMO Engine\, A Model Driven Compiler to Execute User&#39\;s Intent and Ma
 nage Service Lifecycle by Multi Layer State Machine\n\nSpeaker:\nYinben Xi
 a (Huawei Technologies)\n\nAbstract:\nIn last year&#39\;s NetPL workshop\,
  I introduced an intent oriented network service programming language - NE
 MO. This time\, I will introduce NEMO&#39\;s model driven compiler\, which
  compiles intent language to real network executable interface. Second\, I
  will introduce a multi layer state machine engine in NEMO compiler\, whic
 h will handle various changes from equipments\, requirement or governance 
 policy. This engine provides an automatic change management capability for
  whole service lifecycle. In the last\, I will update NEMO&#39\;s open sou
 rce implementation progress.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDr. Yinben Xia is a senior s
 taff researcher within Huawei&#39\;s network research department from 2008
 . He dedicated his research effort in network architecture and SDN technol
 ogies. In recent two years\, he lead a team to design and developer a NaaS
  (Network as a Service) programming language (NEMO Project). He owns 15 pa
 tents in related domain. He is leading a team to carry out SDN/NEMO resear
 ch in Beijing. Before joining Huawei\, Dr. Xia worked at IBM China Researc
 h Lab for 4 years after he got PH.D from Beijing University of Aeronautics
  and Astronautics.\n\n* Keynote Title:\nInteractive Query for Dynamic Netw
 ork Analytics\n\nSpeaker:\nHaoyu Song (Huawei Technologies)\n\nAbstract:\n
 Network data plane needs to be interactively programmed in order to suppor
 t Dynamic Network Analytics (DNA). We envision the high level DNA applicat
 ions can be break down into a set of queries and the queries can be furthe
 r compiled into incremental configurations to the data plane. We emphasize
  the need to define standard DNA APIs and/or query language for DNA system
 .\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nHaoyu Song is a principal architect at Huawei Technolog
 ies. He is a leading researcher on SDN programmable data plane. His curren
 t research interests span all aspects of the SDN/NFV ecosystem. He was a r
 esearcher at Bell Labs\, Alcatel-Lucent before joining Huawei. He hold a d
 octoral degree in computer engineering from Washington University in St. L
 ouis.\n\n
